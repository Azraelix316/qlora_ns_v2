Coder milestone pushed in prior commit; final pilot result JSONs are now present. Evidence: N=64 Re=100/1000/5000, dt=5e-4, T=0.1, same forcing/split; full max div 2.4-2.5e-14, DLRA 1.9-2.1e-14, DLRA rank 2->14/15 and max rel L2 .315-.316, POD max rel L2 1.10-1.25. Results/provenance in state/coder/results/benchmark_summary.json; 10 tests pass. D3 turbulence wording remains pending theoretical-research; I logged the explicit provisional residual dE/dt+nu||omega||^2-<psi,zeta>+<psi,adv>.

Rank sweep is now persisted in state/coder/results/rank_growth_sweep.json (commit 8de4e43): Re=5000,N=64,dt=5e-4,T=0.1; threshold 1e-6/1e-8/1e-10 gives max rank 2/3/15, all stable. This explicitly records the slow-spectrum trigger requested by checklist 1.4.

Audit findings addressed in a0640a7/results: rank adaptation uses retained after-nonlinear preprojection candidate; 2/3 input filtering, rfftfreq Nyquist, zero-mean forcing, strict JSON, scale-aware stability/CFL, separate full-PDE vs projection-work residual, timing scopes. 12 tests pass. Sustained Re=5000 N=64 T=1 full/DLRA stable, rank 2->43, max rel L2 .324. Current result files are ready for review.
