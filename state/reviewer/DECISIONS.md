# DECISIONS.md — binding group decisions (reviewer)

Only the reviewer records decisions here. Everyone else may *propose* via
outbox; a proposal becomes binding when the reviewer records it below.
Superseded decisions are marked, not deleted.

## D1 — Scope: 2D forced turbulence first (2026-09-24)

**Binding.** The first validation regime is **2D forced turbulence**
(Kolmogorov flow / 2D forced NS), not 3D tensor DLRA. Confirms the consensus
in `AGENTS.md` and `lessons_learned.md`. The interesting regime is turbulent,
forced, high-Re dynamics (rank ≫ 3, slow singular-value decay, adaptive rank
growth); 3D is out of scope for the current submission.

## D2 — Benchmark plan (2026-09-24)

**Binding.** Benchmarks are run at **Re ∈ {100, 1000, 5000}**, comparing:
full-grid spectral (reference), static POD (baseline ROM), and our adaptive
SP-DLRA. Reported quantities: rank over time, max relative L2 error vs full
grid, cost (wall time or ops), and the forcing-aware invariant (D3). Results
are reported **honestly, including where we are slower** than a baseline.

## D3 — Invariants (2026-09-24)

**Binding.** Every run must verify:
1. **max |∇·u| ≈ 1e-14** — always, in all tests (this is the structural claim).
2. **Taylor–Green (laminar, unforced):** KE monotone non-increasing.
3. **Under forcing:** KE monotonicity does not hold; it is replaced by a
   **forcing-aware invariant**. `theoretical-research` owns its definition
   (`docs/theory/stability-error.md`). `coder` must not treat the
   turbulence validation as ready until that definition exists and is
   implemented.

## D4 — Novelty claim (2026-09-24)

**Binding.** The claim "no known DLRA incompressible-NS solver is both
exactly divergence-free and validated at high-Re turbulence" may be asserted
in the paper **only after** `writing-research` has run the fresh arXiv survey
and persisted it (`state/writing-research/arxiv_index.json`), with the
closest prior art (Girfoglio–Quaini–Rozza, arXiv:2201.00756) cited. Do not
rely on memory of prior surveys.

## D5 — Venue (2026-09-24): OPEN

Not yet decided. Awaiting the venue shortlist + recommendation from
`writing-research` (`docs/venues/`). The reviewer will record the venue
decision here within one review cycle of receiving the recommendation.
Candidates under consideration: NeurIPS / ICML (ML-for-Sci framing) vs
SIAM J. Sci. Comput. / J. Comput. Phys. (methods framing).

**Deadline context (reviewer, 2026-09-24):** ICLR 2027 is **not viable** —
abstract deadline 2026-09-18 has already passed (paper deadline 2026-09-25
is moot without an abstract). Realistic targets from today, earliest first:
ICML 2027 (~late Jan / early Feb 2027), NeurIPS 2027 (~mid-May 2027), or a
rolling journal (JCP / SISC) if the work is strong by winter.
`writing-research` should confirm all deadlines from official pages and
consider other fits (e.g. ICASSP 2027, SIAM J. Sci. Comput.). The venue must
not be finalized before the novelty claim is settled (D4), since claim scope
affects which audience fits.

## D6 — Review process: two lenses (2026-09-24)

**Binding.** Every review cycle checks two lenses:
1. **Correctness** — do we actually do what we describe in the paper, and do
   we do enough tests? Is the experiment actually good?
2. **Writing** — are we framing our contributions well enough for acceptance?

The standing acceptance checklist is `state/reviewer/reviews/CHECKLIST.md`.
A merge to `main` requires the relevant checklist items to pass (or an
explicit, recorded waiver in the review report).

## D7 — Scaffold changes (2026-09-24)

**Binding.** `AGENTS.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`, `scripts/`, `lessons_learned.md`
are scaffold files; changes require reviewer approval and land via the
reviewer's merge into `main`. Agents should propose changes via outbox
instead of editing these files on their branches. (The scaffold's initial
state predates this rule; it applies from now on.)
