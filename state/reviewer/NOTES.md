## Mission

Quality gate and **sole integrator**: review each agent's branch, merge
approved work into `main`, arbitrate open decisions. See `PROTOCOL.md` —
you are the only agent allowed to write to `main`.

## Owned paths (write only here)

- `state/reviewer/` — this board, `reviews/` (one report per review),
  `DECISIONS.md` (binding group decisions)

## Review lenses (D6)

1. **Correctness** — do we actually do what we describe in the paper, and do
   we do enough tests? Is the experiment actually good?
2. **Writing** — are we framing our contributions well to get accepted?

Standing acceptance criteria: `state/reviewer/reviews/CHECKLIST.md`.

## First TODOs

- [x] Create `state/reviewer/DECISIONS.md` and record:
      1. Scope: 2D forced turbulence first — **confirmed** (D1).
      2. Venue: open — awaiting the `writing-research` survey (D5).
- [x] Review the scaffold (protocol + notes) for gaps; fix on your branch,
      merge to main. (R1: no blocking gaps; recorded D7 scaffold-change rule.)
- [x] First review cycle: check each agent's branch for ownership-rule
      violations; merge whatever is ready. (R1: clean; nothing to merge but
      reviewer state.)

## TODOs — next cycle

- [ ] Re-check branches after agents start: first artifacts in dependency
      order — (a) theoretical-research: forcing-aware invariant definition
      (D3.3, blocks coder's turbulence work); (b) writing-research:
      arxiv_index.json persisted + venue recommendation (D4, D5);
      (c) coder: Taylor–Green smoke test with invariant logs;
      (d) writer: paper skeleton.
- [ ] Record the venue decision (D5) when writing-research's recommendation
      lands.
- [ ] As results land, apply CHECKLIST lens 1 (provenance, invariants,
      validation ladder L1–L4, tests, honesty); as the draft matures, apply
      lens 2 (framing, structure, figures, venue fit).

## Log

- 2026-09-24 R2: reviewed writing-research's two pushes (`17b796d` →
  `6a41b2a`). Verified all 27 `refs.bib` arXiv IDs against arxiv.org abs
  pages (arXiv API returns 406 in this env — used abs-page citation_* meta
  tags): **27/27 genuine**, mandatory `girfoglio2022pod` present. Index at
  21 entries; `2412.05988v2` still misattributed (correct id for the
  kinetic-simulations review: 2412.05912, reviewer-verified). Venue
  shortlist revised (ICASSP added, timing column, draft strategy) but every
  deadline unverified and no recommendation sent to reviewer. Verdict:
  **HOLD** — blockers: (1) fix/delete the bad index id, (2) persist the
  0-hit "divergence-free ∧ dynamical low-rank" query (string, date, count);
  non-blocking: ranked venue recommendation with source-cited deadlines,
  align NOTES "15 unique" count with 21, optional `relevant` flag. Recorded
  **D8** (scaffold amendment: `docs/venues/` + `docs/structure/` assigned to
  writing-research; existing content accepted as-is — scaffold gap, not
  agent error) and amended PROTOCOL.md ownership table + AGENTS.md key
  paths accordingly. Sent R2 verdict via outbox. Other branches unchanged
  (coder `4c28a7b`, writer `57d6e11`, theoretical-research `c2d2e6a`).
  Pushed; merged reviewer branch to main.
- 2026-09-24 (post-R1): recorded ICLR 2027 deadline finding — abstract
  deadline 2026-09-18 already passed, so ICLR 2027 is not viable; added
  deadline context to D5 in DECISIONS.md and an addendum to the
  writing-research outbox nudging earliest-realistic targets (ICML 2027,
  NeurIPS 2027, rolling JCP/SISC). Pushed + merged to main (cde65f1).
  Continuing to poll; no agent activity yet (nudges delivered 16:49–16:51,
  pickup pending).
- 2026-09-24 R1: ran `start`; audited all branches (only coder ahead of
  fork point, net-zero diff); no ownership violations; wrote DECISIONS.md
  (D1 scope, D2 benchmarks, D3 invariants, D4 novelty gating, D5 venue
  open, D6 two-lens process, D7 scaffold rule); wrote reviews/CHECKLIST.md
  and reviews/2026-09-24-R1-scaffold-and-first-cycle.md; sent start-of-work
  messages to coder, theoretical-research, writer, writing-research.
- 2026-09-24 Worktree + branch created as part of the 5-agent scaffold
  (see `PROTOCOL.md`).
